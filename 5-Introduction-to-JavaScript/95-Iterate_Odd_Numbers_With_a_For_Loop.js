// This lesson showed that we can iterate by more than just one increment at a time by having us add two for each loop to access either just even or just odd numbers.
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

for (var i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
   myArray.push(i);
}
