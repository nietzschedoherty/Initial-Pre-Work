// This lesson showed how to append variables to strings using the plus equals operator.
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "fun, interesting, and useful!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
